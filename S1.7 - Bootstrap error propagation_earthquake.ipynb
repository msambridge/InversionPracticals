    "This practical explores the use of the Bootstrap method for uncertainty estimation. Recall that both linear theory error estimation as well as Monte Carlo error propagation required nowledge of the size of the data errors in the form of a data covariance matrix.   The bootstrap can be used to estimate error in a solution without knowledge of  size of errors in the data. Instead it can be applied by assuming that the data errors, or data residuals more usually, are independently, identically distributed, IID. This can be a reasonable assumption if data error correlation is minimal.\n",

    "Here we apply the bootstrap to a nonlinear inverse problem that requires an iterative solution. \n",

    "As an example, we will consider is earthquake location.\n",

    "Here we make use of a ready made python script to iteratively update an earthquake location for the $(x,y,z)$ and origin time, $t$.  We use a homogeneous crustal Earth model with wave speed, v=5.8 km/s. \n"
